### The Snake Oil in Snake Cable?

-----
_**Context:** 11:03PM EST, back on the living room couch in Queens.  It's a tad cooler tonight -- maybe because the summer season is coming to an end. I have Miles Davis' cover of "[Bye Bye Blackbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_Bye_Blackbird)" playing in my head. There are the three versions that have persisted in my memory:_
- _The [original 1957 recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV2lNHfSXBQ) from his album 'Round About Midnight._
- _A [live recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bz-hByzv4) from 1960 at The Olympia in Paris, with John Coltrane._
- _A cover of Miles' cover from a gentleman who was testing out his plastic cornet at a wedding gig or something. I can't seem to find it on YouTube or Facebook for the life of me, but the timbre of his instrument sounded absolutely beautiful in the spacious hall._

_I ended up listening to the recording at the Olympia. Because I love the album cover design. All is well._

I've been spending just about every afternoon/evening for the past five days looking at hardware to implement this project. I had dreamed of making a polished audio rig since I was a child. Now that I have a little spending money, I'll try to fulfill as many of these desires as I can alongside this project.

Starting with the interface with my computer, I decided to buy a [Cymatic uTrack 24](https://cymaticaudio.com/utrack24-productpage/). The unit comes from a relatively new company somewhere in Germany, and it seems to be an absolute gem: It's an interface that can either work as (1) a standalone 24ch recorder, (2) a standalone 24ch playback device, or (3) a 24in 24out USB interface -- and it fits in a succinct 1RU chassis and **runs new for about $550**[^1][^2].

Like many other 16+ channel interfaces, the analog connectors are [DB25's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature). Great type of interconnect for saving panel space and for plugging in 8 balanced channels at a time. Not so great for directly patching microphones and instruments in live settings. To use this anywhere other than the dusty, untouched nooks behind racks and consoles, I'm going to need some type of a snake. 

[^1]: for those who know the ballpark of prices for interfaces that are 16x16 I/O, you probably know that $550 is a wild low price. For those who don't know: $550 a wild low price. And I snagged a new one on Reverb for just under $450 weeeee
[^2]: I've collected enough thoughts while comparing this with other high-channel-count interfaces to warrant a whole other blog post, but I'll go into that once the unit arrives.
